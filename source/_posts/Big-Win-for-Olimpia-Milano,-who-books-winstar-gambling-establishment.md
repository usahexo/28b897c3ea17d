#  Milan Bookies Win Out as Olimpia take Casino

The Serie A side Olimpia Milano have won the battle to take over the Casino Club di Campione d’Italia, with the bookmakers in the city of Milan set to benefit from increased tourism. The closure of the casino – once Europe’s largest – due to financial problems had put the future of the resort into doubt, but now it looks as though preparations are being made for its reopening under new ownership.

Several potential buyers were interested in taking over the casino, but it was eventually Olimpia who were victorious, sealing the deal with a €27 million bid. This will see them become the only legal operator of casinos in Italy, and is likely to be a major boon for the city’s tourism industry.

The casino has been closed since July 2013, when its owners were unable to repay their debts. This led to widespread job losses and concerns about the resort’s future. However, with Olimpia now at the helm, it seems as though things are looking up for Campione d’Italia.

The closure of the casino had a major impact on Milan’s bookmakers, who saw their business drop by as much as 50%. However, they are now expecting a resurgence in interest thanks to Olimpia’s takeover. In addition to this, there are also plans to expand and improve the facilities at Campione d’Italia, which is sure to attract more visitors in years to come.

#  New Casino Winner: Olimpia Milano

After a long and tiring basketball season, the final playoffs are now reaching their climax. The best of the best teams are going head to head for the title. Among these teams, one has managed to make a real impression: Olimpia Milano from Italy.

This team was crowned champion of the Euroleague playoffs, managing to overcome CSKA Moscow, a more-than-experienced opponent. At their home court in Mediolanum Forum, they managed to win by 101-96 in the decisive game 7. An impressive victory that crowned them as the new European champions!

The roster of this Italian team is really something special. With players such as Alessandro Gentile, Mike James and Brad Wanamaker, they have everything it takes to go all the way. Combine this with an experienced coach like Simone Pianigiani, and you have a real contender for any title.

This victory will without doubt give them a lot of confidence for the upcoming season. They will now be able to face any team in Europe with no fear, knowing that they can beat anyone on their day. We can definitely expect great things from this team in the near future!

#  Gambler's Luck Favours Olimpia Milano

The cream of European basketball, FC Barcelona Lassa, was put to the sword by Olimpia Milano in the semi-finals of the Euroleague Playoffs. The Milanese team will now face CSKA Moscow in the final after an impressive 95-85 victory.

Milano played brilliantly as a team and took advantage of Barcelona's poor shooting. The Spanish champions were unable to find their range from beyond the arc, hitting just nine out of 33 shots (27%).

The Lombardian side- led by Brian Oliver with 21 points- raced into a commanding early lead and never looked back. In particular, Jamel McLean was impressive for Milano, notching up 17 points and 12 rebounds.

Veteran point guard Sergio Rodriguez was also key for Olimpia Milano, orchestrating the offence and providing some important baskets when they were needed. He finished with 16 points and six assists.

Barcelona never gave up hope but were ultimately undone by their poor shooting and lack of cohesion on offense. They will now have to pick themselves up for next season, where they will look to regain the Euroleague crown.
