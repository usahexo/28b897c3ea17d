Caesars Lodge and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey is a great place to find cheaper stuff. The casino has a lot of deals going on all the time, from food to shopping. You can get some really great deals if you know where to look.

One of the best-kept secrets at Caesars is the Dogs Playing Poker painting located near the main entrance. This painting is massive – it’s 10 feet tall and 20 feet wide. It’s also one of the most expensive paintings in the world, with a price tag of $25 million.

But there’s a way to get your hands on this painting without spending a dime. All you have to do is visit the casino during one of its art auctions. These auctions are held every few months, and they feature works from some of the most famous artists in the world.

You don’t even have to be a casino member to participate in these auctions – anyone can bid on the paintings. And since all of the proceeds go to charity, you can feel good about yourself while you’re picking up a bargain.

In addition to art, Caesars also has some great deals on clothes and jewelry. One of the best places to find cheap clothes is Winners Circle, which is located near the entrance of the casino. You can find some really great deals on designer clothes here, including brands like Nike and Adidas.

And if you’re looking for something sparkly, head over to The Vault jewelry store. This store has some really amazing jewelry at incredibly low prices. You can find everything from diamond necklaces to Rolex watches at The Vault – and all for much less than you would pay elsewhere.
