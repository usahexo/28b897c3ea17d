#  Nhentai Shows How Poker Faced Girls Truly Feel Žalgiris

Nhentai, a well-known hentai website, recently released a manga called Žalgiris (“The Victors”) which tells the story of a talented high school poker face girl and her classmates.

In the manga, the protagonist, Takuma, is a skilled poker face girl who manages to keep her cool under pressure. However, she eventually falls in love with one of her classmates, Shinichi, and becomes afraid that he will find out her true feelings.

Fortunately, Takuma is able to overcome her fear and confess to Shinichi. He then reveals that he also has feelings for her, and the two of them are happily married.

This manga is a great example of how poker face girls truly feel. Many people assume that they’re emotionless or cold-hearted, but in reality they’re just good at hiding their true emotions.
