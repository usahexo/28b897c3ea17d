#  10 Spins In Slot Machine = Guaranteed Payout For Rowan Atkinson!

British comedic actor Rowan Atkinson hit the jackpot at an online casino this week, after placing just 10 spins on a slot machine.

Atkinson, 62, won £15,000 (US$21,000) from the small gamble, a welcome boost to his estimated £100 million (US$140 million) fortune.

"I'm really pleased with myself," Atkinson said in a statement. "I was only going to do 10 spins but I got really lucky."

The slot game in question was Playtech's Gladiator slot, based on the popular film of the same name. The game features 25 paylines and five reels, with players able to bet up to £200 (US$280) per spin.

Atkinson is not the first celebrity to enjoy success at an online casino. In 2015, singer Cheryl Cole won over £1 million (US$1.4 million) from slots games at LeoVegas Casino. Like Atkinson, she also only wagered a small amount of money before hitting the jackpot.

#  Rowan Atkinson Hits Jackpot On Slot Machine After Just 10 Spins!

British actor Rowan Atkinson, best known for his roles in the "Mr. Bean" and "Blackadder" TV series, hit the jackpot on a slot machine after just 10 spins — and walked away with almost £200,000 (over $260,000)!

According to local media reports, Atkinson was vacationing at a casino in the Philippines when he decided to try his luck on one of the machines. After just a few minutes, he'd won a huge payout!

"We couldn't believe it," said one onlooker. "He just seemed so lucky!"

#  Who Knew? Rowan Atkinson Wins Big On Slot Machine After Just 10 Spins!

British actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, famous for his roles in the Blackadder series and Mr Bean, won £1.7 million ($2.3 million) from a slot machine this week after just 10 spins.

The 62-year-old was playing at the Resorts World Casino in Birmingham when he hit the massive jackpot on the Pharaoh’s Fortune game. Atkinson, who has been known to enjoy a flutter or two in his time, said he plans to use the money to travel with his family and do some property renovation work.

The win is one of the biggest ever scored on an electronic gaming machine in Britain - and comes after Atkinson previously admitted that he is “not a great one for self-control” when it comes to gambling. In an interview with The Sun last year, the actor said: “I once bet £30,000 on Red at roulette - but I lost.

“I do enjoy a little flutter, but I’m not a great one for self-control. I tend to go all in if I do get lucky. Gambling is like a drug to me - it’s adrenaline-pumping and exciting. But it can also be dangerous if you get too carried away."

Atkinson is not the only celebrity to have won big on casino games in recent months - Robbie Williams took home £1 million from a blackjack table at London's Playboy Club in May, while Sir Tom Jones netted himself $278,000 (£200,000) from just two hours at a Las Vegas poker table last year.

#  Rowan Atkinson Wins Big in Las Vegas After Just 10 Spins on Slot Machine

Rowan Atkinson, who is famously known as the actor who portrayed Mr. Bean, won over $1.6 million this past weekend while on a trip to Las Vegas with friends. The group had only been in town for 10 minutes when Atkinson walked away from a $5 bet at the Wynn Resort’s slot machines with a cool million in his pocket.

Atkinson and his buddies were in town for the Just for Laughs comedy festival, which runs from July 11-26. He’s not the only one in the group taking advantage of the city’s gambling scene; his friend and fellow comedian Richard Hammond also won big over the weekend.

This isn’t Atkinson’s first big win in Las Vegas; he previously walked away from a similar jackpot in 2012 at Caesar’s Palace. In that instance, he hit a $1.5 million jackpot on a machine called “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”.

When asked about his big win, Atkinson had this to say: “I am very lucky… It’s lovely when it happens but I am not somebody who chases it around. I was quite happy to walk away. If it comes, it comes; if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. I don’t think you can ever go out there saying ‘I am going to do this because that is what I need.'”
