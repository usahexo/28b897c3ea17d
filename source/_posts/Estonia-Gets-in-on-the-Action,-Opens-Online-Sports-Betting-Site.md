#  Estonia Gets in on the Action, Opens Online Sports Betting Site

Estonia has become the latest European country to offer online sports betting, joining the likes of the United Kingdom, Spain, and France. The site, estosport.com, went live on Tuesday, November 6 and will be operated by state-owned gambling company Olympic Casino Eesti.

The launch of estosport.com means that there are now five legal online sports betting sites in Estonia. In addition to estosport.com, the others are bet365.com, unibet.com, williamhill.com, and bwin.party. All except for unibet are licensed in Estonia by the country’s gambling authority, the Lasnamäe District Court.

Although it is not yet known how popular estosport.com will be among Estonian bettors, it does offer a number of features that could make it attractive, including a wide range of sporting events available for betting as well as a mobile app that allows users to bet on the go. In addition, estosport offers an extensive selection of bets on eSports events, which is sure to appeal to fans of competitive gaming.

One thing to note is that because Olympic Casino Eesti is government-owned, all profits from estosport will go into state coffers rather than into the pockets of private operators like bet365 and unibet. This could give estosport an advantage over its privately-owned competitors in terms of attracting customers.

#  Estonia Sets The Bar High In Online Sports Betting - Check It Out!

If you are looking for a country that has embraced online sports betting, look no further than Estonia. This small Baltic state has set the bar high when it comes to giving its citizens access to legal and safe sports betting options.

This was a major step forward for the online gambling industry in Estonia, as it gave players more choices and better protection when gambling online.

Since then, the Estonian market for online sports betting has continued to grow. In fact, recent estimates suggest that the market is now worth around €120 million annually. That’s a lot of money up for grabs, and it’s no wonder that so many operators are keen to get a piece of the action!
