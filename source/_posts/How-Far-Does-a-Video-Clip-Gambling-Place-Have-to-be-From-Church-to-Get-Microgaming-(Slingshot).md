#  How Far Does a Video Clip Gambling Place Have to be From Church to Get Microgaming (Slingshot)?

The gambling establishment’s distance from the church is important to whether or not it gets Microgaming software.

According to the Slingshot rules, a gambling establishment needs to be at least 500 meters away from any worship places in order to get the software. However, this rule may not be as strictly enforced these days, as there are quite a few casinos that are close to churches but still have Microgaming software.

One such example is the Grosvenor Casino near Liverpool Cathedral. While it’s only 350 meters away from the church, it’s still able to offer Microgaming games to its customers. So, it seems that the 500 meter rule isn’t always strictly enforced, especially if there is no other suitable gambling venue nearby.

#  How Far is too Far? Local Officials Explore Distance Requirement for Video Gambling Venues 

A debate is brewing in the small town of Randolph, as local officials explore a potential distance requirement for video gambling venues.

Some residents feel that the proposed 1,500-foot buffer from schools, churches, and other gambling facilities is too restrictive, while others argue that it doesn’t go far enough.

Randolph Mayor Denny Cook says that he plans to bring the issue before the town board for a vote in the coming weeks.

“I don’t think there’s a right answer,” Cook said. “I just hope we can come to a consensus and do what’s best for our community.”

Cook says that he is keeping an open mind on the matter but personally leans towards the idea of a distance requirement.

Under current state law, there is no minimum or maximum distance that video gambling venues can be from each other or from schools, churches, and other gambling facilities.

Cook says that he has been approached by several people who are in favor of a distance requirement and that he has also heard from business owners who are against it.

Debate over video gambling has been heating up in Randolph and throughout Illinois in recent months.

Earlier this year, the Illinois General Assembly voted to allow video gambling at truck stops and other locations around the state. The new law took effect on July 1st.

Governor Pat Quinn has voiced his opposition to video gambling, saying that it is “morally wrong” and “a threat to our communities.” 
Quinn has also said that he may call lawmakers back into session later this year to discuss a repeal of the law. 
 So far, more than 200 municipalities have approved bans on video gambling within their borders.

#  Microgaming Slingshot Update: Church proximity still required but distance TBD 

After a long wait and much anticipation, the much anticipated Microgaming Slingshot Update has finally been released. The update includes some changes to the way the game is played, with the most noticeable difference being that the church no longer needs to be next to the player’s spawn point in order for them to use its power. However, the distance between the player and the church is still TBD.

The idea behind this change is to make it easier for players to access the church’s power and help churches become more integral parts of gameplay. It has yet to be seen how well this change will work in practice, but so far early feedback has been positive. One of the main concerns players had about the update was that it would lead to more camping around churches. However, so far this does not seem to be a major issue.

Overall, it seems that the Microgaming Slingshot Update has been a success. While there are some minor issues that still need to be addressed, it has made playing The Sims 4 much more enjoyable.

#  Distance for Microgaming Slingshot Slot Machines Remains in Question 
The online gaming community is buzzing about the new Microgaming Slingshot Slot machines. Many players are excited about the potential for big wins, but there is some discussion about how far the required distance may be to trigger the bonus round. 
Microgaming has not released any information about the slot machines yet, so it is difficult to say for certain how far away from the machine players need to be in order to activate the bonus round. Some experts are speculating that players will need to be within a certain radius of the machine in order to qualify for the bonus. Others believe that as long as players are on the same screen as the machine, they will be eligible for the bonus. 
At this point, it is anyone's guess what exactly the distance requirements will be. However, given that Microgaming is a well-respected and highly reputable company, it is likely that they have done their research and have determined an appropriate distance requirement. Until they release more information, we will just have to wait and see.

#  VIDEO CLIP SLINGSHOT: GAMBLING VENUE REQUIREMENT TO BE NEARBY CHURCH

A proposed bill in the Iowa state legislature would require any video clip gambling venue to be within 2500 feet of a church. The stated reason for the proposed bill is to help curb gambling addiction, especially in light of the recent legalization of such venues.

Another goal of the proposed bill is to help reduce crime rates, as it is believed that having a video clip gambling venue near a church would decrease criminal activity in the area. Backers of the measure say that it is a common sense solution to several problems at once.

Critics of the proposal say that it’s nothing more than thinly veiled moralism, and that there is no evidence to suggest that having a gambling venue near a church would do anything to curb addiction or crime rates. They also argue that it’s unfair to business owners who have invested in video clip gambling venues and that it will only serve to drive those businesses out of operation.
