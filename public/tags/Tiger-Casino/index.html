        <h1 id="Texas-amp-Utah-Ban-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Texas-amp-Utah-Ban-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Texas &amp; Utah Ban Online Gambling"></a>Texas &amp; Utah Ban Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, May 8th, the state of Texas passed a bill to ban online gambling. This was in addition to a previous bill passed in February that banned gambling devices such as slot machines and roulette wheels. This new bill, HB 3375, makes changes to the state’s Penal Code and explicitly bans online gambling. The only exception is for horse racing bets made through licensed individuals in the state.</p>
<p>Utah also passed a similar measure outlawing internet gambling on Wednesday, May 9th. The bill, SB 97, prohibits any individual or entity from participating in or advertising internet gambling within Utah. It also forbids Utah residents from placing any bets remotely. Like the Texas bill, there are a few exemptions for horseracing and fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>Both of these bills come shortly after the Department of Justice overturned the federal ban on sports betting last month. This decision has given states more authority to legalize gambling within their borders. So far, at least six states have introduced bills to legalize some form of online gambling since the DOJ’s ruling.</p>
<p>Supporters of these bans argue that they are necessary to protect consumers and prevent gambling addiction. However, opponents claim that these bans will only push people towards unregulated and possibly unsafe offshore sites. They also argue that it is hypocritical for conservative states like Texas and Utah to outlaw online gambling while allowing traditional forms of gambling like casinos and lotteries.</p>
<h1 id="Dragon-Legend-Slot-Banned-In-Two-States"><a href="#Dragon-Legend-Slot-Banned-In-Two-States" class="headerlink" title="Dragon Legend Slot Banned In Two States"></a>Dragon Legend Slot Banned In Two States</h1><p>Gambling authorities in two US states have ruled that the Dragon Legend slot game is not fair, and has subsequently been banned from casinos in those states.</p>
<p>The slot game, which is produced by IGT, has been found to have a defect which gives players an unfair advantage. This defect causes the game to payout more often than it should, meaning players are more likely to win than they should be.</p>
<p>As a result, the Missouri Gaming Commission and the Nevada Gaming Control Board have both ruled that the game is not fair, and must be pulled from casinos in their states. Other states may also follow suit, depending on the results of further investigations.</p>
<p>Dragon Legend is not the only IGT slot game to be hit with this kind of ban. Earlier this year, three other IGT slots - Golden Goddess, Kitty Glitter, and Pharaoh’s Fortune - were all banned from New Jersey casinos for the same reason.</p>
<h1 id="No-Gambling-For-You-In-Texas-And-Utah"><a href="#No-Gambling-For-You-In-Texas-And-Utah" class="headerlink" title="No Gambling For You In Texas And Utah!"></a>No Gambling For You In Texas And Utah!</h1><p>Utah and Texas may have legalized certain types of gambling, but that doesn’t mean you can gamble in those states. In fact, Utah specifically prohibits all forms of gambling, while Texas only allows a limited number of games to be played in casinos.</p>
<p>Gambling is defined as risking something of value on the outcome of an event that is determined by chance. This includes casino games, lottery tickets, and even betting on sporting events. While some people may see gambling as a harmless way to have some fun, research has shown that it can actually be very addictive and lead to negative consequences like financial problems, addiction, and even crime.</p>
<p>That’s why many states have decided to prohibit gambling altogether. Utah is one such state, and it has a long history of opposing gambling in any form. The state has a constitution which specifically prohibits all forms of gambling, and there are no casinos or racetracks allowed in the state.</p>
<p>Texas is a bit more lenient when it comes to gambling. The state allows casinos to operate under a limited number of conditions, and racetracks are also allowed. However, Texas does not allow any type of online gambling, and anyone caught participating in illegal gambling activities can face criminal charges.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to gamble in the USA, you’ll have to head to one of the other 47 states that allow it. Or better yet, why not try your hand at some other forms of entertainment? There’s plenty to do in Utah and Texas without risking your hard-earned money on chance games.</p>
<h1 id="Dragon-Legends-No-More-–-gambling-Banned-In-TX-amp-UT"><a href="#Dragon-Legends-No-More-–-gambling-Banned-In-TX-amp-UT" class="headerlink" title="Dragon Legends No More – gambling Banned In TX &amp; UT"></a>Dragon Legends No More – gambling Banned In TX &amp; UT</h1><p>The dragon has long been a creature of legend and myth. These days, the dragon is more likely to be found in the form of a digital image on a casino gaming screen than in the sky or on a battlefield. But that may all be changing soon, as gambling with real money on these games is now being banned in Texas and Utah.</p>
<p>For years, casinos across the United States have been reaping the benefits of state-sanctioned gambling. This has included everything from casino table games to slot machines and sports betting. But lawmakers in Texas and Utah have had enough, and are now seeking to prohibit real-money gambling on dragon legends and other similar games.</p>
<p>Texas Rep. Poncho Nevárez put forth House Bill 2167 earlier this year, with the goal of preventing gambling on digital images of creatures like dragons, unicorns, and phoenixes. The bill easily passed through the Texas House of Representatives but is currently stalled in the Senate Committee on Licensing and Administrative Procedures.</p>
<p>Utah lawmakers are also taking action against real-money gambling on dragon legends and other fantasy games. A bill sponsored by Rep. LaVar Christensen would add such games to the list of prohibited activities under Utah’s Gambling Act. The bill unanimously passed through the House but is currently awaiting Senate approval.</p>
<p>What’s behind this sudden crackdown against gambling on dragon legends? One reason may be concerns over addiction. Withdrawal symptoms from online gambling can be severe, including anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, and even suicidal thoughts. Lawmakers may feel that prohibiting gambling on dragon legends will help to protect citizens from developing addiction problems.</p>
<p>Another reason for the crackdown may be money laundering concerns. Unlike regulated casino games where all bets are tracked, there’s no way to know who is winning or losing when playing digital dragon legends games. This could make it easier for criminals to launder money through unregulated gaming sites.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for this crackdown, it’s clear that gambling with real money on dragon legends and other fantasy games is becoming increasingly unpopular among state lawmakers. As more states move to ban such activities, it may only be a matter of time before they are relegated to the realm of legend and myth once again</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Now-Prohibited-In-2-States"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Now-Prohibited-In-2-States" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Now Prohibited In 2 States"></a>Online Gambling Now Prohibited In 2 States</h1><p>In a move that surprised many, online gambling was outlawed in the states of Louisiana and Iowa this past week. The bills were signed into law by the governors of each state, respectively. This makes it the second and third states in the nation to prohibit online gambling, following Wisconsin’s footsteps.</p>
<p>The new laws make it a crime for any person within the state to gamble online. Violators can be sentenced to up to five years in prison and face fines up to $10,000.</p>
<p>When asked about the motivation behind the bills, a spokesperson for Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal stated that the governor believes that online gambling is a “risky behavior” that can lead to addiction and other negative consequences.</p>
<p>Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa echoed these sentiments, saying that he views online gambling as a “form of illegal gambling” that can be harmful to citizens.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bills argue that they are unnecessary and will only serve to drive gamblers underground and into shady offshore websites. They also claim that the laws will have a negative impact on state revenue, as residents will simply take their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how these new laws will play out, but it is clear that they are yet another sign of the shifting landscape when it comes to gambling in the US.</p>
