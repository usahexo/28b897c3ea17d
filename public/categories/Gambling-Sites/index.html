<p>In the manga, the protagonist, Takuma, is a skilled poker face girl who manages to keep her cool under pressure. However, she eventually falls in love with one of her classmates, Shinichi, and becomes afraid that he will find out her true feelings.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Takuma is able to overcome her fear and confess to Shinichi. He then reveals that he also has feelings for her, and the two of them are happily married.</p>
<p>This manga is a great example of how poker face girls truly feel. Many people assume that they’re emotionless or cold-hearted, but in reality they’re just good at hiding their true emotions.</p>

<li>Kristina Miličiūtė Žalgiriškė is one of the last professional poker faced girls in the world. She competes and wins against men, often without revealing any emotion on her face. This is a skill that has largely been forgotten in a society that prizes emotional outbursts over stoicism.</li>
<li>Miličiūtė Žalgiriškė was born into a family of wrestlers in Lithuania. She started playing poker at an early age, and quickly developed a reputation for her calm demeanour and sharp skills at the table. In an age where players are often jittery and emotional, Žalgiriškė’s poker face is a true asset.</li>
<li>Žalgiriškė has travelled the world competing in professional poker tournaments. She has won dozens of major championships, including the European Poker Tour and the World Series of Poker. Despite her many successes, she remains humble and down to earth. Her poker face is never more evident than when she is facing off against her male opponents.</li>
<li>In a world that prizes outsized personalities and emotional displays, Žalgiriškė’s grace under pressure is refreshing. She is a reminder that there is value in keeping your emotions in check, and that sometimes it’s best to let your cards do the talking.</li>
