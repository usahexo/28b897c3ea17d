<p>The 61-year-old was playing roulette at the exclusive Aspinall’s club in Mayfair when he hit the jackpot. A source close to Atkinson said: “He’s delighted – it’s a huge amount of money. He was playing blackjack earlier in the evening but switched to roulette for the big win.”</p>
<p>Atkinson is a well-known gambler and has been known to play high stakes games in casinos around the world. In 2010, he lost £1 million in a day playing baccarat at London’s Playboy Club.</p>
<p>The actor is thought to have blown most of his fortune on gambling and expensive cars, but he will still be left with a sizeable nest egg from his win on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="£870-000-win-for-‘Mr-Bean’-actor-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#£870-000-win-for-‘Mr-Bean’-actor-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="£870,000 win for ‘Mr Bean’ actor Rowan Atkinson"></a>£870,000 win for ‘Mr Bean’ actor Rowan Atkinson</h1><p>Actor Rowan Atkinson has won an £870,000 out-of-court settlement from a tabloid newspaper that printed a story claiming he had fathered a child with a woman he had met in a bar.</p>
<p>Atkinson, who is famous for his Mr Bean character, took action against the Sun after it published the story in 2006. The newspaper has now agreed to pay him damages and costs.</p>
<p>Atkinson’s lawyer told the court that the story had caused his client great distress and embarrassment. He also said that Atkinson was not the father of the child in question.</p>
<p>In a statement, Atkinson said: “I am pleased that this matter has been resolved to my satisfaction.”</p>
<p>The Sun has also apologised to Atkinson for printing the story.</p>
<h1 id="Rowan-Atkinson-Wins-£630-000-In-Casino"><a href="#Rowan-Atkinson-Wins-£630-000-In-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Rowan Atkinson Wins £630,000 In Casino"></a>Rowan Atkinson Wins £630,000 In Casino</h1><p>Rowan Atkinson banked £630,000 from playing blackjack in a London casino over a two-day period.<br>The 61-year-old actor was reportedly gambling with £5,000 chips and walked away a winner on each of the occasions he played.<br>A source told The Sun: ‘He’s quite a serious gambler and doesn’t like to lose. He was very pleased with himself.’</p>
<p>Atkinson is no stranger to casino wins – back in 2012 he scooped almost £1 million from playing blackjack and baccarat at casinos in Monaco and London.</p>
<p>In an interview with Graham Norton in 2012, he said: ‘I do enjoy the buzz of risking large sums of money but I’m not addicted to it. I can stop any time I want.’ </p>
<p>Casinos often use celebrity gamblers to attract high rollers and Atkinson is one of their most successful players. His winnings will doubtless come as a relief to him after he split from his wife of 24 years last year. </p>
<p>The actor is now said to be dating Louise Ford, who is half his age.</p>
<h1 id="Mr-Bean-Star-Wins-£470-000-at-Roulette"><a href="#Mr-Bean-Star-Wins-£470-000-at-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Mr Bean Star Wins £470,000 at Roulette"></a>Mr Bean Star Wins £470,000 at Roulette</h1><p>Actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, famously known for his role as Mr Bean, has won £470,000 ($632,000) at roulette in a high-stakes casino game.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old was playing at the Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco when he scooped the huge jackpot.</p>
<p>Atkinson is an experienced gambler and has been known to enjoy a flutter on the green baize table on occasion. In fact, this isn’t the first time he’s won big at roulette - in 2012 he walked away with £1.5 million after hitting a series of lucky numbers.</p>
<p>According to reports, the actor was playing with a group of friends when he landed the massive win. After placing his bets on red and black, Atkinson watched as the ball landed on black 17 - resulting in him taking home almost half a million dollars.</p>
<p>When asked about his big win by reporters, Atkinson said: “I’m very lucky really. I’ve had some good fortune at the casino over the years.”</p>
<p>He also joked that he might have to give up his day job and live off his roulette winnings from now on: “I might have to give up being an actor and just become a professional gambler!”</p>

<p>The Mr Bean star was playing at the Caesars Palace casino when he hit the jackpot on Saturday (1 April 2017).</p>
<p>Atkinson, 62, was spotted cheering and high-fiving fellow players after his lucky win.</p>
<p>He is not the only celebrity to have enjoyed success at the roulette table – actors Bruce Willis and Leonardo DiCaprio are also said to be fans of the game.</p>

The closure is expected to impact approximately 290 employees.</p>
<p>This closure is due to a number of factors, including increased competition in the region from other casinos and gaming facilities, as well as regulatory pressures.</p>
<p>Resort World Casino has been a proud member of the Connecticut community for more than seven years, and we remain committed to doing what is best for our employees and our guests. We thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>Guests with questions or concerns can visit the Guest Relations desk at the casino or call (866) 718-2211.</p>

The casino has been accused of forcing customers to gamble and then refusing to pay out when they lost.</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Investigators will be looking into whether or not the casino coerced customers into playing games and then refused to pay out when they lost. They will also be looking into whether or not the casino engaged in any fraudulent activity, such as deceptive advertising or unfair lending practices.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>This is not the first time that the Resort World Casino has been investigated by state officials. Last year, the casino was fined $1 million for violations of state gaming law.</p>
<h1 id="Resort-World-Casino-Closes-CT-Gaming-Operations"><a href="#Resort-World-Casino-Closes-CT-Gaming-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Resort World Casino Closes CT Gaming Operations"></a>Resort World Casino Closes CT Gaming Operations</h1><p>On Sunday, Resort World Casino in Connecticut closed its casino floor and gaming operations. The closure impacts over 125 employees who are now out of work.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the casino said that the closure is temporary and is due to “unforeseen circumstances.” No other details were provided.</p>
<p>The casino has been in operation since late 2017 and features a 50,000-square-foot gaming floor with over 500 slot machines and table games. It also includes a hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear what the closure means for the future of the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Gaming-Commission-to-Probe-Resort-World-Casino-Closure"><a href="#Connecticut-Gaming-Commission-to-Probe-Resort-World-Casino-Closure" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Gaming Commission to Probe Resort World Casino Closure"></a>Connecticut Gaming Commission to Probe Resort World Casino Closure</h1><p>The Connecticut Gaming Commission has announced that it will open an investigation into the sudden closure of Resort World Casino in neighboring Springfield, Massachusetts. The closure, which left some 2,000 employees without work, came as a surprise to many in the area, and officials are eager to find out what led to it.</p>
<p>“We are deeply troubled by the news of the closure of Resort World Casino Springfield,” said CGC chairman Alan Schanzer in a statement. “We will be launching an investigation into the matter as soon as possible in order to understand what happened and how we can prevent a situation like this from happening again.”</p>
<p>Schanezer added that the commission would be reaching out to both the casino’s management and its workforce in order to get a full understanding of what led to the closure. He also thanked Governor Ned Lamont for his support in this effort.</p>
<p>Lamont issued his own statement shortly after Schanzer’s, saying that he was “deeply concerned” by the closure and that his administration was “ready to do whatever we can to help.” He added that he had spoken with Schanzer and other gaming commission officials and pledged his full support for their investigation.</p>
<p>The closure of Resort World Casino was seen as a major blow to the local economy, as it had been one of the largest employers in Springfield. In addition, many believed that it had potential to bring new business and tourism dollars into the area. Now it remains unclear what will become of the casino’s property or its employees.</p>
