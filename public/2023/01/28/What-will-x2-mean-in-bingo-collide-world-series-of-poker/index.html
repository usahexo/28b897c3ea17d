<h1 id="Achieving-x2-and-more-in-bingo-collide-world-series-of-poker"><a href="#Achieving-x2-and-more-in-bingo-collide-world-series-of-poker" class="headerlink" title="Achieving x2 and more in bingo collide world series of poker!"></a>Achieving x2 and more in bingo collide world series of poker!</h1><p>There are many strategies that you can use to help you win more money when playing in the world series of poker. In this article, we will discuss one such strategy that can help you achieve x2 and more in your wins.</p>
<p>The strategy is called bingo collide and it is a simple two step process that can be used to great effect in any form of poker. The first step is to find a player who is willing to put in a large amount of money. This player can be anyone at the table, including the button, small blind or big blind. Once you have found this player, the second step is to make a large bet on the flop head-on.</p>
<p>If your opponent calls your bet, then you have two options: hit your draw on the turn or river and claim the pot, or bluff and hope they fold. If your opponent folds, then you have won a large pot without having to show down your hand. Even if you don’t hit your draw, as long as your opponent folds then you will have still made a profit on the hand.</p>
<p>The beauty of bingo collide is that it doesn’t rely on getting lucky; as long as you stick to playing only against opponents who are willing to put in a lot of money, then you will be successful with this strategy most of the time. So next time you are playing in the world series of poker, give bingo collide a try – you may be surprised at just how profitable it can be!</p>
