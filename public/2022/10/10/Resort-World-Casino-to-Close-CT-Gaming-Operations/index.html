      <h1 id="Resort-World-Casino-to-Close-CT-Gaming-Operations"><a href="#Resort-World-Casino-to-Close-CT-Gaming-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Resort World Casino to Close CT Gaming Operations"></a>Resort World Casino to Close CT Gaming Operations</h1><p>After much deliberation, Resort World Casino has come to the difficult decision to close its Connecticut gaming operation by the end of October. The closure is expected to impact approximately 290 employees.</p>
<p>This closure is due to a number of factors, including increased competition in the region from other casinos and gaming facilities, as well as regulatory pressures.</p>
<p>Resort World Casino has been a proud member of the Connecticut community for more than seven years, and we remain committed to doing what is best for our employees and our guests. We thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>Guests with questions or concerns can visit the Guest Relations desk at the casino or call (866) 718-2211.</p>

The casino has been accused of forcing customers to gamble and then refusing to pay out when they lost.</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Investigators will be looking into whether or not the casino coerced customers into playing games and then refused to pay out when they lost. They will also be looking into whether or not the casino engaged in any fraudulent activity, such as deceptive advertising or unfair lending practices.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>This is not the first time that the Resort World Casino has been investigated by state officials. Last year, the casino was fined $1 million for violations of state gaming law.</p>
<h1 id="Resort-World-Casino-Closes-CT-Gaming-Operations"><a href="#Resort-World-Casino-Closes-CT-Gaming-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Resort World Casino Closes CT Gaming Operations"></a>Resort World Casino Closes CT Gaming Operations</h1><p>On Sunday, Resort World Casino in Connecticut closed its casino floor and gaming operations. The closure impacts over 125 employees who are now out of work.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the casino said that the closure is temporary and is due to “unforeseen circumstances.” No other details were provided.</p>
<p>The casino has been in operation since late 2017 and features a 50,000-square-foot gaming floor with over 500 slot machines and table games. It also includes a hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear what the closure means for the future of the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Gaming-Commission-to-Probe-Resort-World-Casino-Closure"><a href="#Connecticut-Gaming-Commission-to-Probe-Resort-World-Casino-Closure" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Gaming Commission to Probe Resort World Casino Closure"></a>Connecticut Gaming Commission to Probe Resort World Casino Closure</h1><p>The Connecticut Gaming Commission has announced that it will open an investigation into the sudden closure of Resort World Casino in neighboring Springfield, Massachusetts. The closure, which left some 2,000 employees without work, came as a surprise to many in the area, and officials are eager to find out what led to it.</p>
<p>“We are deeply troubled by the news of the closure of Resort World Casino Springfield,” said CGC chairman Alan Schanzer in a statement. “We will be launching an investigation into the matter as soon as possible in order to understand what happened and how we can prevent a situation like this from happening again.”</p>
<p>Schanezer added that the commission would be reaching out to both the casino’s management and its workforce in order to get a full understanding of what led to the closure. He also thanked Governor Ned Lamont for his support in this effort.</p>
<p>Lamont issued his own statement shortly after Schanzer’s, saying that he was “deeply concerned” by the closure and that his administration was “ready to do whatever we can to help.” He added that he had spoken with Schanzer and other gaming commission officials and pledged his full support for their investigation.</p>
<p>The closure of Resort World Casino was seen as a major blow to the local economy, as it had been one of the largest employers in Springfield. In addition, many believed that it had potential to bring new business and tourism dollars into the area. Now it remains unclear what will become of the casino’s property or its employees.</p>
