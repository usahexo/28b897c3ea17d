      <h1 id="State-Attorneys-General-Team-Up-To-Take-On-Illegal-Gambling-Websites"><a href="#State-Attorneys-General-Team-Up-To-Take-On-Illegal-Gambling-Websites" class="headerlink" title="State Attorneys General Team Up To Take On Illegal Gambling Websites"></a>State Attorneys General Team Up To Take On Illegal Gambling Websites</h1><p>The recent proliferation of illegal gambling websites has prompted the establishment of a new task force by a coalition of US state attorneys general. The alliance, which is calling itself “Operation Takedown”, will work to identify and shut down the illegal websites.</p>
<p>The task force was announced on Monday by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is leading the group. Joining him are the attorneys general of California, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Schneiderman said that the task force will use a variety of tools to take down the illegal gambling websites, including civil and criminal investigations, enforcement actions and consumer education.</p>
<p>“Illegal online gambling ruins lives and victimizes innocent citizens across the country,” said Schneiderman in a statement. “This new task force will use all of the tools at our disposal to crack down on these lawless operations and protect New Yorkers from being scammed out of their hard-earned money.”</p>
<p>The illegal gambling websites have been proliferating in recent years as states have moved to legalize various forms of gambling. The sites often allow people to bet on sporting events or play casino games without paying taxes or licensing fees. They also typically do not have security measures in place to protect players from fraud or cheating.</p>
<p>In addition to the state attorneys general, Operation Takedown is also being supported by several other organizations, including the American Gaming Association (AGA) and iDEA America (an online gambling industry trade group).</p>
<p>The AGA applauded the formation of Operation Takedown in a statement released on Monday. “Illegal offshore gaming operations prey on American consumers and undercut regulated gaming businesses that follow state and federal laws,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of AGA. “We commend Attorney General Schneiderman for his leadership in assembling this important coalition and look forward to working with him to shut down these rogue operators.”</p>
<h1 id="Justice-Department-Announces-New-Crusade-Against-Online-Gambling-Sites"><a href="#Justice-Department-Announces-New-Crusade-Against-Online-Gambling-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Justice Department Announces New Crusade Against Online Gambling Sites"></a>Justice Department Announces New Crusade Against Online Gambling Sites</h1><p>On Wednesday, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a new crusade against online gambling sites. In a press release, the DOJ stated that it is “committed to aggressively enforcing federal law against those who violate it by operating illegal gambling businesses.”</p>
<p>This statement is in line with the DOJ’s recent efforts to prosecute online poker sites. In April, the DOJ seized the domain names of several major poker websites and charged their owners with money laundering and violating the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).</p>
<p>The UIGEA, which was passed in 2006, prohibits banks and other financial institutions from processing payments to online gambling sites. This has forced many of these sites to shut down operations in the United States.</p>
<p>The new crackdown will likely have a similar effect on online gambling sites. The DOJ press release specifically mentions the UIGEA, stating that “the Department will continue to enforce this law robustly against those who operate illegal gambling businesses.”</p>
<p>The DOJ also released a list of “Dirty Dozen” online gambling sites that it plans to target. The list includes well-known brands such as PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Betfair. These sites will likely be subject to seizure of their domain names and prosecution for money laundering and other offenses.</p>
<p>The crackdown on online gambling comes at a time when many states are considering legalizing online poker. New York and California are two states that are currently considering bills that would legalize online poker.</p>
<h1 id="FBI-Raids-Offices-Of-Major-Online-Gambling-Company"><a href="#FBI-Raids-Offices-Of-Major-Online-Gambling-Company" class="headerlink" title="FBI Raids Offices Of Major Online Gambling Company"></a>FBI Raids Offices Of Major Online Gambling Company</h1><p>The FBI raided the offices of a major online gambling company on Wednesday as part of a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>According to law enforcement officials, the raid is part of an ongoing probe into money laundering and other financial crimes. Several employees of the company were detained by the FBI, but no arrests have yet been made.</p>
<p>The online gambling company is one of the largest in the world, with operations in dozens of countries. It is not yet clear what specific laws the company may have violated, or how much money is believed to be involved.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the FBI has targeted online gambling companies. In 2011, agents raided several major poker websites as part of a crackdown on illegal gambling operations.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Site-Operator-Arrested-Charged-With-Fraud"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Site-Operator-Arrested-Charged-With-Fraud" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Site Operator Arrested, Charged With Fraud"></a>Online Gambling Site Operator Arrested, Charged With Fraud</h1><p>An online gambling site operator was arrested and charged with fraud this week.</p>
<p>The site, which is currently offline, is accused of taking deposits from customers but not paying out any winnings.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of cases involving online gambling sites.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a similar site was shut down by the FBI after it was revealed that the operators were stealing tens of millions of dollars from customers.</p>
<p>In that case, the site’s owners were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<h1 id="Class-Action-Lawsuit-Filed-Against-Major-Online-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Class-Action-Lawsuit-Filed-Against-Major-Online-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Major Online Gambling Site"></a>Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Major Online Gambling Site</h1><p>On July 5, a class action lawsuit was filed against a major online gambling site by three of its customers. The plaintiffs, who are residents of Illinois, New Jersey, and Nevada, allege that the site engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices.</p>
<p>The suit claims that the gambling site lured customers into depositing money with false promises of bonuses and rewards, only to then refuse to pay out any winnings. In addition, it is alleged that the site operated a “blacklist” system which prevented certain customers from withdrawing their funds, even if they had met all applicable withdrawal criteria.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory damages as well as punitive damages.</p>
