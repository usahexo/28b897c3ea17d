<p>The company, which is based in Las Vegas, says that the new feature will be available at all of its casinos starting next month. Gamblers will be able to turn off the machines using a button on the cabinet.</p>
<p>The move has been made in an effort to Address Problem Gambling. “We want to provide our customers with as much control over their gambling experience as possible,” said the company’s CEO. “This new feature will give them the power to take a break from the machine whenever they need it.”</p>
<p>The decision has been welcomed by addiction experts, who say that it will help to address the growing problem of problem gambling. “This is a step in the right direction,” said one expert. “It’s important that casino operators provide their customers with ways to control their gambling behavior.”</p>

<p>The deal was reportedly made in response to pressure from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-23/slot-machine-makers-agree-to-let-gamblers-turn-off-machines">state and federal officials</a>, who have been investigating whether the industry’s design encourages problem gambling. </p>
<p>Both Penn National Gaming and Caesars Entertainment Corp have agreed to include a “lose all” button on their machines, which will allow players to stop any further wagers rather than continuing to play and lose money. Other slot machine makers are expected to follow suit, Bloomberg reports. </p>
<p>The new policy comes as the gambling industry faces increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators amid concerns that slot machines are designed in a way that makes it difficult for players to quit when they’re losing money. </p>
<p>In March, Illinois became the latest state to pass a bill outlawing “self exclusion” policies at casinos, which allow people with gambling problems to voluntarily ban themselves from casinos. The move came after <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pennsylvanias Problem Gambling Lawsuit Could Signal More Legal Action 1554471920">Pennsylvania’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against 18 casino operators</a> last year accusing them of fraud and racketeering for implementing such policies.</p>
<h1 id="Turning-Off-Slot-Machines-Could-Mean-Bigger-Winnings-for-Gamblers"><a href="#Turning-Off-Slot-Machines-Could-Mean-Bigger-Winnings-for-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Turning Off Slot Machines Could Mean Bigger Winnings for Gamblers"></a>Turning Off Slot Machines Could Mean Bigger Winnings for Gamblers</h1><p>​Slot machines are a mainstay of casinos around the world, but new research suggests that turning them off could lead to bigger payouts for gamblers.</p>
<p>​A study by researchers at the University of British Columbia found that when slot machines are turned off, gamblers make more intelligent choices about where to put their money and how much to wager.</p>
<p>​”Our findings suggest that when slot machines are not available, people take a more strategic approach to gambling, which leads to improved decision-making and bigger payouts,” said Professor Elke Weber, who led the study.</p>
<p>​Weber and her team recruited 181 participants and asked them to play a game in which they could win between $1 and $10. The participants were split into two groups: one group played the game while slot machines were available, while the other group played the game while the machines were turned off.</p>
<p>​The results showed that players in the first group lost an average of $2.94 per round, while players in the second group lost an average of $1.76 per round – a difference of 41%.</p>
<p>​”These findings have significant implications for casino gambling policy,” said Weber. “Turning off slot machines could be a way for casinos to improve overall gambler satisfaction and reduce gambling losses.”</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-Maker-to-Let-Gamblers-Turn-Off-Machines-Whenever-They-Please"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Maker-to-Let-Gamblers-Turn-Off-Machines-Whenever-They-Please" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Maker to Let Gamblers Turn Off Machines Whenever They Please"></a>Slot Machine Maker to Let Gamblers Turn Off Machines Whenever They Please</h1><p>Slot machine maker MGM has announced that it will soon allow gamblers to turn off their machines whenever they please. The new feature, set to launch within the next few weeks, will be available at all of MGM’s approximately 2,000 slot machines across the country.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to providing our guests with a comfortable and enjoyable gaming experience,” said MGM spokesperson Debra Sandler in a statement. “With this new feature, we’re giving them more control over their game play.”</p>
<p>To turn off a machine, players will simply need to press a button on the cabinet. They will then be given a preset amount of time - typically between five and fifteen minutes - to leave the machine. If they choose to stay on the machine after their time is up, they will be unable to continue playing until they re-enable it.</p>
<p>Sandler added that MGM is also working on a way for players to limit how much money they spend on any given night. “We’re looking into ways for guests to set spending limits so they can enjoy their gaming experience without going over budget,” she said.</p>
<p>The new features come in the wake of increasing criticism of slot machines, which have been dubbed “the crack cocaine of gambling.” Advocates argue that the machines are designed to be addictive and that they fuel gambling addiction rates across the country.</p>
<p>MGM’s decision is being seen as a major win by advocates, who hope that other casino chains will follow suit.</p>
