      <h1 id="Rowan-Atkinson-wins-£7-million-in-casino"><a href="#Rowan-Atkinson-wins-£7-million-in-casino" class="headerlink" title="Rowan Atkinson wins £7 million in casino"></a>Rowan Atkinson wins £7 million in casino</h1><p>British comedian Rowan Atkinson, famous for his roles in the TV series “Blackadder” and the movie “Mr. Bean”, won £7 million at a casino in London.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old was playing roulette at the exclusive Aspinall’s club in Mayfair when he hit the jackpot. A source close to Atkinson said: “He’s delighted – it’s a huge amount of money. He was playing blackjack earlier in the evening but switched to roulette for the big win.”</p>
<p>Atkinson is a well-known gambler and has been known to play high stakes games in casinos around the world. In 2010, he lost £1 million in a day playing baccarat at London’s Playboy Club.</p>
<p>The actor is thought to have blown most of his fortune on gambling and expensive cars, but he will still be left with a sizeable nest egg from his win on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="£870-000-win-for-‘Mr-Bean’-actor-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#£870-000-win-for-‘Mr-Bean’-actor-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="£870,000 win for ‘Mr Bean’ actor Rowan Atkinson"></a>£870,000 win for ‘Mr Bean’ actor Rowan Atkinson</h1><p>Actor Rowan Atkinson has won an £870,000 out-of-court settlement from a tabloid newspaper that printed a story claiming he had fathered a child with a woman he had met in a bar.</p>
<p>Atkinson, who is famous for his Mr Bean character, took action against the Sun after it published the story in 2006. The newspaper has now agreed to pay him damages and costs.</p>
<p>Atkinson’s lawyer told the court that the story had caused his client great distress and embarrassment. He also said that Atkinson was not the father of the child in question.</p>
<p>In a statement, Atkinson said: “I am pleased that this matter has been resolved to my satisfaction.”</p>
<p>The Sun has also apologised to Atkinson for printing the story.</p>
<h1 id="Rowan-Atkinson-Wins-£630-000-In-Casino"><a href="#Rowan-Atkinson-Wins-£630-000-In-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Rowan Atkinson Wins £630,000 In Casino"></a>Rowan Atkinson Wins £630,000 In Casino</h1><p>Rowan Atkinson banked £630,000 from playing blackjack in a London casino over a two-day period.<br>The 61-year-old actor was reportedly gambling with £5,000 chips and walked away a winner on each of the occasions he played.<br>A source told The Sun: ‘He’s quite a serious gambler and doesn’t like to lose. He was very pleased with himself.’</p>
<p>Atkinson is no stranger to casino wins – back in 2012 he scooped almost £1 million from playing blackjack and baccarat at casinos in Monaco and London.</p>
<p>In an interview with Graham Norton in 2012, he said: ‘I do enjoy the buzz of risking large sums of money but I’m not addicted to it. I can stop any time I want.’ </p>
<p>Casinos often use celebrity gamblers to attract high rollers and Atkinson is one of their most successful players. His winnings will doubtless come as a relief to him after he split from his wife of 24 years last year. </p>
<p>The actor is now said to be dating Louise Ford, who is half his age.</p>
<h1 id="Mr-Bean-Star-Wins-£470-000-at-Roulette"><a href="#Mr-Bean-Star-Wins-£470-000-at-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Mr Bean Star Wins £470,000 at Roulette"></a>Mr Bean Star Wins £470,000 at Roulette</h1><p>Actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, famously known for his role as Mr Bean, has won £470,000 ($632,000) at roulette in a high-stakes casino game.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old was playing at the Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco when he scooped the huge jackpot.</p>
<p>Atkinson is an experienced gambler and has been known to enjoy a flutter on the green baize table on occasion. In fact, this isn’t the first time he’s won big at roulette - in 2012 he walked away with £1.5 million after hitting a series of lucky numbers.</p>
<p>According to reports, the actor was playing with a group of friends when he landed the massive win. After placing his bets on red and black, Atkinson watched as the ball landed on black 17 - resulting in him taking home almost half a million dollars.</p>
<p>When asked about his big win by reporters, Atkinson said: “I’m very lucky really. I’ve had some good fortune at the casino over the years.”</p>
<p>He also joked that he might have to give up his day job and live off his roulette winnings from now on: “I might have to give up being an actor and just become a professional gambler!”</p>

<p>The Mr Bean star was playing at the Caesars Palace casino when he hit the jackpot on Saturday (1 April 2017).</p>
<p>Atkinson, 62, was spotted cheering and high-fiving fellow players after his lucky win.</p>
<p>He is not the only celebrity to have enjoyed success at the roulette table – actors Bruce Willis and Leonardo DiCaprio are also said to be fans of the game.</p>
