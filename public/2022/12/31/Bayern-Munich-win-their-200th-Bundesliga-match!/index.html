      <h1 id="Bayern-Munich-win-their-200th-Bundesliga-match"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-win-their-200th-Bundesliga-match" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich win their 200th Bundesliga match!"></a>Bayern Munich win their 200th Bundesliga match!</h1><p>FC Bayern München have won their 200th Bundesliga game in a row, defeating FC Augsburg 3-0 on Saturday. Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski bagged a brace and Kingsley Coman got the other as the Bavarians extended their lead at the top of the table to 19 points.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich started brightly and deservedly took the lead through Robert Lewandowski in the 26th minute. The Polish international was played through by Thomas Muller and he finished clinically past Marwin Hitz in the Augsburg goal.</p>
<p>The second goal arrived just after half time, with Kingsley Coman scoring his 10th Bundesliga goal of the season. Coman was put through by Lewandowski and he showed great composure to slot home past Marwin Hitz.</p>
<p>Lewandowski then got his second of the game and his 20th of the season in the 73rd minute, finishing coolly past Marwin Hitz after he was played through by Arjen Robben.</p>
<p>It was a typically dominant performance from Bayern Munich, who have now won 200 Bundesliga games in a row – a record which will be difficult for any side to break.</p>
<h1 id="Bayern-Munich-come-from-behind-to-win-their-200th-Bundesliga-game"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-come-from-behind-to-win-their-200th-Bundesliga-game" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich come from behind to win their 200th Bundesliga game!"></a>Bayern Munich come from behind to win their 200th Bundesliga game!</h1><p>The Bavarians are now just one win shy of becoming the first ever German club to amass 200 Bundesliga victories.</p>
<p>It was an open game at the Allianz Arena, with chances for either side in the early stages. The best opportunity of the first half fell to James Rodriguez, but his shot was saved by RB Leipzig ‘keeper Peter Gulacsi.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich eventually took the lead in the second half, with Serge Gnabry finding the net from close range. However, Leipzig hit back just minutes later, as Jean-Kevin Augustin scored to make it 1-1.</p>
<p>It looked as though Bayern were going to have to settle for a point, but they found a late winner through Robert Lewandowski. The Polish striker was played through by Kingsley Coman, and he made no mistake in slotting the ball home.</p>
<p>With this win, Bayern Munich move up to third place in the Bundesliga table. They are now just two points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund, and seven points behind leaders RB Leipzig.</p>
<h1 id="Bayern-Munich-achieve-another-milestone-winning-their-200th-Bundesliga-game"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-achieve-another-milestone-winning-their-200th-Bundesliga-game" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich achieve another milestone, winning their 200th Bundesliga game!"></a>Bayern Munich achieve another milestone, winning their 200th Bundesliga game!</h1><p>The Bundesliga table never tells the full story. This was evident on Saturday as Bayern Munich celebrated their 200th Bundesliga victory with a 3-1 win away at Hoffenheim.</p>
<p>The Bavarian giants have made a habit of starting slowly in the last few seasons, but they are now up to second in the table after four successive wins. While they might not be able to catch runaway leaders Borussia Dortmund, this latest milestone is still an impressive achievement.</p>
<p>Bayern’s success in the Bundesliga can be largely credited to head coach Jupp Heynckes. The 72-year-old has won six league titles as a manager and his experience is proving invaluable to the current side.</p>
<p>This season, Heynckes has reinvigorated Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who have both been in excellent form. Robert Lewandowski has also been scoring goals for fun, with 16 so far in all competitions.</p>
<p>Bayern are not just winning games thanks to their star players, however. Their team spirit is also excellent and they are proving difficult to beat on their own patch.</p>
<p>Hoffenheim were unlucky not to score in Saturday’s game, but Bayern held on for another important win. next up for them is a crunch clash against Schalke 04 at the Allianz Arena.</p>
<h1 id="Bayern-Munich-set-a-new-record-with-their-200th-Bundesliga-win"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-set-a-new-record-with-their-200th-Bundesliga-win" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich set a new record with their 200th Bundesliga win!"></a>Bayern Munich set a new record with their 200th Bundesliga win!</h1><p>On Saturday, Bayern Munich set a new record with their 200th Bundesliga win. This was a huge milestone for the club, as they continue to cement themselves as one of the best teams in German football history.</p>
<p>This particular win was also an important one, as it kept Bayern atop the Bundesliga table. They are now four points clear of second-place Borussia Dortmund, and have a game in hand on their rivals.</p>
<p>This latest victory was also a testament to the club’s consistency. Since 2003, when they were first promoted to Germany’s top division, Bayern have never finished lower than third. They have also won seven Bundesliga titles during that time span.</p>
<p>This latest win was accomplished with a dominant performance from the Bavarians. In fact, they outshot their opponents 21-5 and had nine shots on target.</p>
<p>The goalscorers for Bayern were Mats Hummels and Robert Lewandowski, who both found the back of the net in the first half. Hummels’ goal was his first since joining Bayern last summer, while Lewandowski’s goal was his league-leading 28th this season.</p>
<p>Bayern will now turn their attention to next week’s Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid. This will be a very tough matchup for the Germans, but they are certainly capable of pulling off an upset against the Spanish giants.</p>
<h1 id="200-–-a-number-that-stands-for-success-and-tradition-at-Bayern-Munich"><a href="#200-–-a-number-that-stands-for-success-and-tradition-at-Bayern-Munich" class="headerlink" title="200 – a number that stands for success and tradition at Bayern Munich"></a>200 – a number that stands for success and tradition at Bayern Munich</h1><p>In the early 1900s, football was an emerging sport in Germany. In 1900, the first German football championship was held. Six teams participated in the inaugural competition, with three rounds of matches determining the champion. Bayern Munich was one of those teams, and they’ve been a part of the Bundesliga ever since its inception.</p>
<p>200 is also significant for Bayern Munich because it’s the number of points they earned during the 2013-14 Bundesliga season. This is a record for the most points ever earned in a single Bundesliga season and it underscores Bayern’s dominance in German football.</p>
<p>To put 200 into perspective, no other team has ever earned more than 179 points in a Bundesliga season – and that was Borussia Dortmund back in 2011-12. So not only is 200 a record for Bayern Munich, but it’s also a record that may never be beaten.</p>
<p>What makes 200 even more impressive is that Bayern didn’t just earn this total by winning a lot of games. The Bavarians also had an impressive goal difference, scoring 223 goals while only allowing 34 against. This demonstrates both their offensive and defensive prowess, and shows why they are considered one of the best clubs in world football.</p>
