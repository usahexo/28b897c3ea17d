      <h1 id="What-is-the-Hot-81-Game"><a href="#What-is-the-Hot-81-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Hot 81 Game?"></a>What is the Hot 81 Game?</h1><p>The Hot 81 Game is a fun, new dice game that is quickly gaining in popularity. The game is based on the classic game of Yahtzee, but with a fun, new twist.</p>
<p>To play the Hot 81 Game, you will need five dice and a score sheet. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by rolling the dice. You can roll the dice three times per turn, and you can keep any of the resulting combinations.</p>
<p>The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. The different combinations are worth different point values:</p>
<p>1 point – Three of a kind<br>2 points – Four of a kind<br>5 points – Full house<br>10 points – Flush<br>15 points – Straight<br>30 points – Sixes</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-premise-of-the-Hot-81-Game"><a href="#What-is-the-premise-of-the-Hot-81-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is the premise of the Hot 81 Game?"></a>What is the premise of the Hot 81 Game?</h1><p>The Hot 81 Game is a variant of the classic game of blackjack which allows players to make more strategic choices and rewards skill over luck. The premise of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-basic-rules-of-the-Hot-81-Game"><a href="#What-are-the-basic-rules-of-the-Hot-81-Game" class="headerlink" title="What are the basic rules of the Hot 81 Game?"></a>What are the basic rules of the Hot 81 Game?</h1><p>In order to win at Hot 81, players must first familiarize themselves with the game’s basic rules. In blackjack, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Players are dealt two cards and can choose whether or not to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible while remaining ahead of the dealer. If a player gets 21 points exactly (a blackjack), they automatically win regardless of what the dealer has. In Hot 81, players can also choose to split their cards into two separate hands, doubling their bet in the process. However, if players choose to split their cards and one hand subsequently goes bust (exceeds 21), they lose both bets.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-card-values-work-in-Hot-81"><a href="#How-do-card-values-work-in-Hot-81" class="headerlink" title="How do card values work in Hot 81?"></a>How do card values work in Hot 81?</h1><p>In Hot 81, all numbered cards are worth their face value (i.e. a 2 card is worth 2 points). Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are each worth 10 points. An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what would be most advantageous for the player.</p>
<h1 id="What-bonuses-are-available-in-Hot-81"><a href="#What-bonuses-are-available-in-Hot-81" class="headerlink" title="What bonuses are available in Hot 81?"></a>What bonuses are available in Hot 81?</h1><p>There are a number of different bonuses available in Hot 81 which add an extra layer of excitement and strategy to the game. One such bonus is the Split Bonus, which rewards players for splitting their cards into two separate hands. If both hands subsequently beat the dealer, players receive double their original bet amount back as a bonus payout. There is also a Double Down Bonus which pays out triple the player’s original bet amount if they double down and beat the dealer’s hand.</p>
<h1 id="Who-developed-and-published-the-Hot-81-Game"><a href="#Who-developed-and-published-the-Hot-81-Game" class="headerlink" title="Who developed and published the Hot 81 Game?"></a>Who developed and published the Hot 81 Game?</h1><p>The Hot 81 Game was developed by Atari Inc. and published in 1981. It was one of the first arcade games to feature two-player co-operative gameplay, and it also popularized the use of multipliers in video games.</p>
<p>The game is set in a casino environment, with players trying to earn as many points as possible by hitting winning combinations on the slot machine. The game features three different levels, each with a progressively higher point value for winning combinations.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-the-Hot-81-Game"><a href="#How-to-play-the-Hot-81-Game" class="headerlink" title="How to play the Hot 81 Game?"></a>How to play the Hot 81 Game?</h1><p>Atari Inc. released very little information about how to play the game, beyond the basic instructions that are shown in the arcade cabinet itself. However, players can attempt to win points by lining up symbols on the screen in order to create combinations. There are three different levels, each with its own point values for different combinations.</p>
<p>In addition, players can earn multipliers by landing consecutive wins. This can significantly increase their score if they are able to keep the winning streak going.</p>

<h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-bonus-features-in-the-Hot-81-Game"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-bonus-features-in-the-Hot-81-Game" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the bonus features in the Hot 81 Game?"></a>What are some of the bonus features in the Hot 81 Game?</h1><p>The Hot 81 Game is an online casino game that offers players a variety of bonus features. Some of the bonus features include the wild symbol, the scatter symbol, and the free spins bonus game.</p>
<p>The wild symbol is a jester hat that can substitute for any other symbol to create a winning combination. The scatter symbol is a golden eagle that can award players with up to 25 free spins when three or more symbols appear anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>The free spins bonus game is activated when three or more scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels. Players will then be awarded with 10 free spins. During the free spins bonus game, all prizes are doubled. Additional free spins can be won during the free spins bonus game by landing additional scatter symbols.</p>
