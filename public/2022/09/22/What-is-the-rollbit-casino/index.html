<h1 id="What-are-the-New-York-Jets"><a href="#What-are-the-New-York-Jets" class="headerlink" title="What are the New York Jets?"></a>What are the New York Jets?</h1><p>The New York Jets are a professional American football team located in the New York metropolitan area. The team is a member of the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Jets play their home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Jets were founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York, an original member of the American Football League (AFL). The team changed its name to Jets in 1963. The Jets advanced to the AFL Championship Game four times and won the championship in 1968. After the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Jets competed in the NFL as a member of the AFC East division. They have reached the playoffs six times and appeared in two Super Bowls, winning one.</p>
<p>Since 1987, the Jets have been owned by Woody Johnson. In 2015, they were valued by Forbes magazine as the sixth most valuable franchise in the NFL, at $2.5 billion.[3]</p>
<h1 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h1><p>The franchise was founded on August 14, 1959, when Sonny Werblin was awarded an American Football League (AFL) franchise for $1 million (the largest amount anyone had ever paid for an NFL or AFL team).[14] He named his team after James E. “Sonny” Widmer, who was then owner of Haar’s Brewery and who had supplied beer to Werblin’s favorite bar.[15][16] However, due to threats from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to scuttle his plans,[17] Werblin moved his team across the Hudson River to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.[1][18]</p>

<p>In 1963, shortly after moving to New Jersey, Sonny Werblin changed the team’s name from Titans to Jets because he felt that “Titans” made his team sound too much like either members of classical mythology or players for one of New York City’s baseball teams (specifically either baseball’s Yankees or Mets).[19][20][21] It has been left up to interpretation whether this was homage to aviation pioneers Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright or Howard Hughes’ short-lived airline Hughes Airwest.[20][21] Interestingly enough both played large roles building their respective companies – Orville with creating a working airplane and Wilbur with financing it while also becoming one of its first pilots; Hughes with creating what would become TWA and purchasing airlines that would be combined into Hughes Airwest as well as investing substantially into Hollywood production studio RKO Pictures. Coincidentally Werblin later became a minority owner of Yankees Entertainment &amp; Sports Network – now YES Network – along with Steinbrenner prior to his passing in 2003.<br>Some reports suggest that Werblin got clearance from Al Davis (of Oakland Raiders fame) who was contacted by William Shea – then head of Major League Baseball’s efforts to get a football expansion franchise – as Shea needed Davis’ consent since he owned rights to Los Angeles due being part owner of AFL’s LA Chargers; Shea promised Davis an ownership stake in any NFL team that began playing west coast games,[22][23] which may have led Davis not oppose (or even support) Werblin moving his newly- minted Titans eastward knowing full well it would put another major league sports franchise into direct competition with Steinbrenner’s Yankees giving fans another option should they not want&#x2F; be able time attend a game at Yankee Stadium (which often sold out). Coincidentally just two years prior Los Angeles transitioned from Rams who originally relocated there from Cleveland converting Memorial Coliseum into their home stadium leaving LA without an NFL club until Raiders announced their return from Oakland). Football Club being dubbed “Titans” also caused some confusion among sports reporters as there was already Nashville-based Arena Football League club also using that moniker which continued through 2009 until changing its name to Dragons; original Tennessee State University college program started playing under that name again starting 2013),<br>Werblin originally wanted Jerry Wolman – then owner of Philadelphia Eagles – to be majority partner[24] but when Wolman declined, Werblin settled on Lionel Taylor[25][26] Former Denver Broncos wide receiver&#x2F;head coach Lou Saban was tabbed as head coach[27] and general manager Dick Schaap was hired.[28] The group opted to take advantage of western New York’s football fever by marketing the club locally as “the eastern outpost of western New York.” This ploy did not work and attendance at games was meager.[29] Their uniforms reflected this lacklustre attitude with washed-out colors and unimaginative designs.[citation needed][30]<br>One bright spot during this time period was running back Matt Snell who led all AFL rushers in 1961 and 1962</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#Who-is-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="Who is Rowan Atkinson?"></a>Who is Rowan Atkinson?</h1><p>Rowan Atkinson is an English actor, comedian, and screenwriter who rose to fame through his portrayal of the title character in the BBC sitcom “Mr. Bean”. He has also starred in films such as “Four Weddings and a Funeral” (1994), “Notting Hill” (1999), and “Johnny English” (2003).</p>
<p>Atkinson was born on 6 January 1955 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, to Eric Atkinson, a farmer and furniture maker, and Ella May Bainbridge, a support worker for people with mental health issues. He has one brother, Rupert. Atkinson was raised Anglican.</p>
<p>After leaving school at 16, Atkinson took up a job at an engineering firm. He then decided to pursue a career in acting and attended the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Upon graduation, he landed his first major acting role as Mr. Bean for the British sitcom of the same name. The show aired from 1990-1995.</p>
<p>In 2001, Atkinson reprised his role as Mr. Bean in the feature film “Bean”. The film was not well received by critics but was commercially successful. The following year, he starred alongside Hugh Grant in the romantic comedy “Notting Hill”. His next major box office success came in 2003 with the action comedy “Johnny English”.</p>
<p>Since then, Atkinson has continued to work in both television and film but has not achieved another hit on the same scale as his earlier work. In 2016, he starred in the BBC series “Maigret’s Night at the Crossroads” and will reprise his role as Mr. Bean later this year in a new animated series for Netflix.</p>
<p>Rowan Atkinson is a highly accomplished actor and comedian whose work has entertained millions of people worldwide. He is most well-known for his portrayal of Mr. Bean but has also starred in many other successful films and television shows. Despite his recent successes however, Atkinson has yet to replicate his earlier career highs and remains slightly underrated compared to some of his contemporaries</p>
